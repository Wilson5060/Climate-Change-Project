            <p>Climate Change refers to the long-term alternation of Earth's Climate, characterized by rising global temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. 
                Human activities, particularly the burning of fossils fuels, are the primary drivers of climate change, releasing significant amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
                The Paris Agreement, a United Nations accord, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. It emphasizes global cooperation, with countries committing to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce emissions. 
                Some potential solutions include exploring renewable energy, carbon taxation, and cap-and-trade systems can offer effective solutions to combat these issues and transition to a sustainable future.</p>

                <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
                <p> Renewable energy comes from natural sources like the sun, wind, water, and Earth's heat, which are replenished naturally. It emits little to no greenhouse gases and pollutants compared to fossil fuels. 
                    To date, fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas, account for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions amd nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions. It is essential to transition to renewable energy
                    to meet the 2030 goal of reducing emissions by half and achieving net-zero by 2050. </p>

                <h2>Carbon Tax</h2>
                <p>
                    A carbon tax sets a price that emitters must pay for each ton of greenhouse gas emissions they produce. 
                    By making pollution more costly, carbon taxes incentivize businesses and individuals to adopt cleaner practices 
                    and technologies. It is considered a straightforward and cost-effective way to reduce emissions, though its success 
                    depends on careful design and implementation.

                    Cap and trade is a market-based policy that sets a cap on emissions and allows companies to buy and sell allowances
